# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System designed to process large documents and answer natural language queries with contextual decisions. The system targets real-world scenarios in insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains, providing intelligent document analysis and query responses through a FastAPI-based REST API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want to submit document URLs and questions via a REST API, so that I can programmatically retrieve intelligent answers from document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/v1/hackrx/run` THEN the system SHALL accept a JSON payload with `documents` (URL string) and `questions` (array of strings)
2. WHEN the request is processed successfully THEN the system SHALL return a JSON response with `answers` array containing responses corresponding to each input question
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL validate a Bearer token from environment configuration
4. IF the request format is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP error codes with descriptive messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically download and process documents from URLs, so that users can analyze documents without manual file handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document URL is provided THEN the system SHALL download the document content automatically
2. WHEN the document is a PDF format THEN the system SHALL parse and extract text content using pypdf
3. WHEN the document is a DOCX format THEN the system SHALL parse and extract text content using python-docx
4. WHEN the document is an email format THEN the system SHALL parse and extract text content appropriately
5. IF the document URL is invalid or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the download failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system processing large documents, I want content to be split into manageable chunks, so that the system can efficiently process and search through document sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is parsed THEN the system SHALL split the content into smaller, manageable chunks
2. WHEN chunking is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic coherence within each chunk
3. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL ensure optimal size for embedding generation and retrieval
4. WHEN chunking is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve document structure and context relationships

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system requiring semantic search capabilities, I want document chunks converted to embeddings and stored in a vector database, so that I can perform intelligent content retrieval.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Jina embedding model v4
2. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in Pinecone vector database
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL maintain metadata linking embeddings to original document chunks
4. WHEN embeddings are stored THEN the system SHALL ensure efficient retrieval capabilities for semantic search
5. IF embedding generation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user asking natural language questions, I want the system to find the most relevant document sections, so that I receive accurate and contextual answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a natural language question is received THEN the system SHALL convert it into an embedding using the same model as document chunks
2. WHEN the question embedding is created THEN the system SHALL perform semantic search against stored document embeddings in Pinecone
3. WHEN semantic search is performed THEN the system SHALL retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on similarity scores
4. WHEN relevant chunks are identified THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance for optimal LLM processing
5. IF no relevant chunks are found THEN the system SHALL handle the scenario appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user expecting intelligent answers, I want the system to use an LLM to generate contextual responses based on retrieved document content, so that I receive accurate and explainable answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN relevant document chunks are retrieved THEN the system SHALL feed them along with the original question to Gemini 2.0 Flash LLM
2. WHEN the LLM processes the input THEN the system SHALL generate a contextual and explainable answer
3. WHEN generating answers THEN the system SHALL provide clear decision rationale based on the document content
4. WHEN multiple questions are asked THEN the system SHALL process each question independently and maintain answer correspondence
5. IF the LLM fails to generate an answer THEN the system SHALL handle the error and provide appropriate feedback

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want all responses in structured JSON format, so that I can easily parse and utilize the system outputs programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return responses in structured JSON format
2. WHEN returning answers THEN the system SHALL ensure the `answers` array corresponds exactly to the input `questions` array order
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses in JSON format
4. WHEN successful responses are generated THEN the system SHALL include all necessary metadata for client processing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid URLs are provided THEN the system SHALL return descriptive error messages
2. WHEN document parsing fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
3. WHEN LLM API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms
4. WHEN vector database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors and maintain system stability
5. WHEN any system component fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information for debugging

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the system, I want clear configuration management through environment variables, so that I can easily configure the system for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables including PINECONE_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, and AUTH_TOKEN
2. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating required configuration
3. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL validate all required API keys and connection parameters
4. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL configuration from environment variables

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want modular and extensible code architecture, so that I can easily add new features and document formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is implemented THEN it SHALL follow a modular architecture with separate functions for parsing, embedding, retrieval, and LLM processing
2. WHEN new document formats need support THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension through pluggable parsers
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include comprehensive docstrings and comments for maintainability
4. WHEN the system is structured THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices and include proper dependency management through requirements.txt
